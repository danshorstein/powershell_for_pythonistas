# powershell_for_pythonistas
NOTE: I heavily use examples and the chapter structure from Al Swigart's excellent Automate the Boring Stuff with Python e-book. The book is publised under Creative Common licence, which allows re-use and adaptation of the materials and examples as long as attribution is given, and any changes are indicated. I took many of the examples and made some small tweaks to adapt for my use here in the Python side of thigs, and re-used the concepts in trying to recreate functionality for PowerShell purposes. Al's ebook can be found here: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/

Start with Chapter 0 and go from there. If you have any edits or suggestions, please feel free to make a pull request!
